The Open Hackathon Platform is a cloud-based platform to enable Hackathon organizers to host an offline/online hackathon with most needed features; Hackathon event participants can use a HTML5 capable web browser to login an Hackathon event, provision his development environment of choice and collaborate with teammates.
